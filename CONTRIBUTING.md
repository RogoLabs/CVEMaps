   ```

## üíª Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.11 or higher
- Git
- A text editor or IDE

### Installation

1. **Create a virtual environment**:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

2. **Install the package in editable mode with dev dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -e ".[dev]"
   ```

3. **Clone the CVE data** (for testing):
   ```bash
   git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5.git cve-data
   ```

### Running the Build Scripts

```bash
# Build main graph
python -m cvemaps.build_graph

# Build alternative graphs
python build_alternative_graphs.py

# Build compact graphs
python build_compact_graphs.py
```

## üéØ How to Contribute

### Types of Contributions

We welcome several types of contributions:

- **Bug fixes**: Fix issues in existing code
- **New features**: Add new visualization types or data processing capabilities
- **Documentation**: Improve README, add examples, write tutorials
- **Tests**: Add unit tests or integration tests
- **Performance improvements**: Optimize data processing or rendering
- **UI/UX**: Improve web interface design and usability

### Workflow

1. **Create a new branch** for your contribution:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   # or
   git checkout -b fix/your-bug-fix
   ```

2. **Make your changes** following the coding standards

3. **Test your changes** thoroughly

4. **Commit your changes**:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "feat: add new visualization type"
   ```

   Use conventional commit messages:
   - `feat:` New feature
   - `fix:` Bug fix
   - `docs:` Documentation changes
   - `style:` Code style changes (formatting)
   - `refactor:` Code refactoring
   - `test:` Adding tests
   - `chore:` Maintenance tasks

5. **Push to your fork**:
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

6. **Create a Pull Request** on GitHub

## üìê Coding Standards

### Python Code

- Follow **PEP 8** style guidelines
- Use **type hints** for function arguments and return values
- Write **docstrings** for all functions and classes (Google style)
- Keep functions focused and under 50 lines when possible
- Use **meaningful variable names**

### Code Formatting

We use automated tools to maintain code quality:

```bash
# Format code with Black
black cvemaps/

# Lint with Ruff
ruff check cvemaps/

# Type check with mypy
mypy cvemaps/
```

### JavaScript/HTML

- Use consistent indentation (2 spaces)
- Follow existing D3.js patterns
- Add comments for complex visualization logic
- Ensure responsive design principles

## üß™ Testing

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
pytest

# Run with coverage
pytest --cov=cvemaps

# Run specific test file
pytest tests/test_build_graph.py
```

### Writing Tests

- Place tests in the `tests/` directory
- Name test files `test_*.py`
- Use descriptive test function names: `test_parse_cve_files_filters_by_date()`
- Mock external dependencies (file system, network calls)
- Aim for high code coverage on core logic

Example test:

```python
def test_build_graph_creates_correct_node_types():
    """Test that build_graph creates CNA and CWE nodes correctly."""
    associations = {("cna1", "CWE-79"): 5}
    cna_names = {"cna1": "Example CNA"}
    
    graph = build_graph(associations, cna_names)
    
    assert graph.nodes["Example CNA"]["type"] == "cna"
    assert graph.nodes["CWE-79"]["type"] == "cwe"
```
